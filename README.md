# makemore — Next-Character Predictor  
### Using Bigram • MLP • CNN • RNN • Transformer

**makemore** is an educational and experiment-friendly project for **character-level next-character prediction**.  
It implements **five different model architectures** on the *same dataset* to compare their performance:

- **Bigram Model**
- **MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)**
- **CNN (1D Convolutional Network)**
- **RNN (LSTM/GRU)**
- **Transformer (GPT-like)**

The goal is to provide a clean, minimal, fully reproducible codebase to understand how neural networks learn text generation at character level.
